# Wave_Function_Simulation
Numerical Solutions to Wave Functions with varying potential.
The First File gives Solutions to a Square Well Potential, meaning the W/F is 0 on both ends
The Second Setup has a Varying (Quadratic) Potential Applied inside the box. Outputs a superposition of different eigenfunctions. You can tweak the amount of solutions found by changing epsilon
